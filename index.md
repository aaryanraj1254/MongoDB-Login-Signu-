Importing Dependencies:
const express = require("express");: This line imports the Express framework, which helps create web servers and handle HTTP requests.
const app = express();: It initializes an Express application by calling the express() function.


Setting Up Template Paths:
const path = require("path");: This line imports the built-in path module, which helps manage file paths.
const templatePath = path.join(__dirname, "../templates");: It creates a path to the templates directory relative to the current file.


Configuring Express:
app.use(express.json());: This middleware parses incoming JSON data from requests.
app.set("view engine", "hbs");: It sets the view engine to Handlebars (hbs) for rendering dynamic HTML templates.


app.set("views", templatePath);: Specifies the directory where views (templates) are stored.
Defining Routes:
app.get("/", (req, res) => { ... });: When someone visits the root URL (“/”), this function responds by rendering a login page (presumably an HTML template).
app.get("/signup", (req, res) => { ... });: Similarly, when someone visits “/signup”, it renders a signup page.
Starting the Server:
app.listen(3000, () => { ... });: The server listens on port 3000 for incoming requests. When it starts, it logs a message saying “Server listening on port 3000.”
Remember, this code sets up a basic web server using Express. It handles routes for login and signup pages. Feel free to ask if you have more questions! 😊
